I wrote this labs in vim editor, so if U use another text editor/IDE, just copy and
paste the content of *.java files to your IDE;
if you want to try smth harder(but more interesting)...
go to folder with files;
open terminal and 
write javac <name of file that contain entry point(main method).java> and
press enter
after that write java <name of file htat contain entry point withou .java
postfix> and press enter
enjoy it...
